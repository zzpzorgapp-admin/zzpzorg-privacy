<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 10, 2026</p>

<p>ZZPzorg ("we", "our", or "the app") is a freelance work tracking and invoicing app. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how you can control it.</p>

<h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

<h3>Account Information</h3>
<p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Password (encrypted and managed by our authentication provider)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business &amp; Work Data</h3>
<p>Data you enter into the app to track your freelance work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work activities (dates, times, durations, earnings)</li>
  <li>Client information (name, address, email, contact person)</li>
  <li>Presets (rate templates for recurring work types)</li>
  <li>Business information (business name, address, KvK number, BTW number, IBAN)</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is provided voluntarily by you and is used solely to provide the app's functionality.</p>

<h3>Analytics (Opt-In Only)</h3>
<p>If you explicitly enable "Gebruiksgegevens delen" in Settings, we collect anonymous usage events such as screen views and feature usage. This data is linked to a randomly generated device identifier, not to your account. Analytics are disabled by default and can be turned off at any time.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>If you submit feedback through the app, we store the message along with your email address (if logged in) so we can follow up if needed.</p>

<h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Location or GPS data</li>
  <li>Photos, camera, or microphone data</li>
  <li>Contacts or calendar data</li>
  <li>Device identifiers (IMEI, advertising ID)</li>
  <li>Browsing history</li>
  <li>Data from other apps</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide the app's core features: activity tracking, invoicing, and data sync across devices</li>
  <li>To authenticate your account and keep your data secure</li>
  <li>To improve the app based on anonymous analytics (only if you opt in)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell, share, or provide your data to any third party for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
<p>Your data is stored in two places:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Using local storage for offline access</li>
  <li><strong>In the cloud:</strong> Using <a href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</a>, a secure cloud platform with encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your data is isolated to your account and protected by Row Level Security, meaning only you can access your own data.</p>

<h2>5. Invoices</h2>
<p>Invoices are generated entirely on your device. No invoice data is sent to our servers. When you share or print an invoice, it uses your device's native sharing functionality.</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party service:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — for authentication, database, and analytics storage. See their <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use any advertising networks, third-party analytics services, or social media tracking.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights &amp; Controls</h2>
<p>You have full control over your data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>View &amp; Edit:</strong> All your data is visible and editable within the app</li>
  <li><strong>Delete individual items:</strong> You can delete any activity, client, preset, or business information at any time</li>
  <li><strong>Disable analytics:</strong> Toggle off "Gebruiksgegevens delen" in Settings at any time</li>
  <li><strong>Delete your account:</strong> Use the "Delete Account" option in Settings to permanently remove your account and all associated data from our servers</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, all associated data is permanently removed from our servers. Local data on your device remains until you uninstall the app.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>ZZPzorg is a business tool designed for adults. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect the most recent revision. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
